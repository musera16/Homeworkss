        Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
        But the very next day, you gave it away<br>
        This year, to save me from tears<br>
        I'll give it to someone special<br>
        Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
        But the very next day, you gave it away<br>
        This year, to save me from tears<br>
        I'll give it to someone special<br>
        <br>
        Once bitten and twice shy<br>
        I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye<br>
        Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?<br>
        Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me<br>
        "Happy Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
        With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it<br>
        Now I know what a fool I've been<br>
        But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again<br>
