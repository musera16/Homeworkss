                What to do in the quest<br>DANGEROUS QUEST This place is an underground 7-room's location where you have to find a way out and try not to get caught by a<br> murderous psycho in the dark or no one knows what will happen to you (no player was harmed in this place)<br><br><br><br>A maximum of 2 people can participate in the quest<br>When 2 people participate in the quest, then the keys are doubled<br><br><br><br><br>What to do to get out of the quest location<br>First you have to collect 4 keys which are hidden in all 7 rooms<br>But this is not easy to do for two reasons.<br>The first reason is the darkness, the location is so dark that you have to be careful when walking and running away from the maniac.<br>The second reason is, of course, the actor, who is dressed in a maniac costume and follows you with a chainsaw in his hands, and who knows the location like the back of his hand and hidden exits.</p>
